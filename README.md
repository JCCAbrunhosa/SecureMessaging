# SecureMessaging
Secure Messaging Service - Simple Email Client for Uni Project


This is simple email project made to test security measures. The project features the following:

  - RSA encryptiom between clients (used for signatures and other security measures)
  - AES encryption between clients and server 
  - Diffie Hellman for AES Key agreement
  - Tags for each message
  - Message signature for integrity and authentication (using the user Citizen Card)
  
 Client creation is made using the Citizen Card (CC) so it's obligatory its use.
 
 
 NOTE: This is not a finished project. Somethings were left half implemented or not even implemented at all but I'm done with it. I already passed this class.
